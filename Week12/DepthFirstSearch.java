/**
 * Overview:
 * It is like exploring a maze and carrying a can of silly string with you that you paint as you explore different paths. You go between nodes through the edges, and when an edge leads you
 * to an unexplored node/edge, you explore that whole path until you reach either a node with no edges off of it, or a node you already visited. If either of these cases are met, you go back
 * one level and explore all the edges that are attached to that node. Once you exhaust those, you go back a level and you keep doing this until you are back at the starting point and all
 * nodes and edges have been visited. Utilizes recursion
